 This book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad 
 incident occurs within his law firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner 
 city streets, and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a 
 chance in the courts. The Street Lawyer is a great book. It is well written and interesting.
